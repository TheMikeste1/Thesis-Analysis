Expert dists: Uniform, Gaussian, Beta(4, 4)


Higher inactive count with worse dist results in worse error
Inversely, higher inactive count with better dist results in better error
Same is true for proxies

Borda and Distance weighting mechanisms seem to be the best when either proxies
and/or inactives are experts, Closest work best when inactives are experts, and
equal weight works best when inactive are skewed (basically leaving it up to the
(hopeful) expertise of the proxies).
